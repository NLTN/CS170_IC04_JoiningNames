Java Project Name:  IC04_JoiningNames

Write a Java program that uses the Scanner class to read 3 strings from the user:  their first name, middle initial and last name.  Display each string, along with its length on a separate line.  For example:

Michael  (length=7)
G (length = 1)
Paulding (length=8)

Then join (concatenate) the three strings into one, with commas in-between.  Make sure each string is capitalized using the toUpperCase() method.  Do not put spaces in-between.  For example:

PAULDING,MICHAEL,G
